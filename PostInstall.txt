To improve your Bdoc experience, I highly recommend you install the Hanna gem

    [sudo] gem install hanna

This will make your Rdocs looks so much better. After you install Hanna, you'll
need to rebuild all of your Rdocs. In order to do that, add this to your ~/.gemrc:

    rdoc: --inline-source --line-numbers --format=html --template=hanna

...then rebuild:

    [sudo] gem rdoc --all --overwrite --no-ri
